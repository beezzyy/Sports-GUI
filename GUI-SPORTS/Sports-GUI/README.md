# Sports-GUI

This project was built for a good friend of mine who owns a small sports prediction company. Before I get started, I'll give you a brief overview of his company's operations. Every morning, my friend predicts which team will win and records his prediction in a text file. It became too redundant for him, so he asked if I could write him a program that would write it down for him. I told him that I could make something that would print automatically on the text file if you pressed a specific button, and that is exactly what my program does.
